### BABY MONITOR
This device was an idea thrown at my from my brother-in-law who is an IT guy. He wanted to make a baby monitor that alerts you to your baby crying if you are gaming. I took it as a good test for me...just to see if I could come up with some sort of basic prototype that could function. This project comes after me learning about hardware
